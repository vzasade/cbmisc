I found that firewalls are somewhat covered here: http://developer.couchbase.com/documentation/server/4.1/security/security-intro.html
But for some reason without concrete port numbers.

So here's what I think should be spelled out in the documentation:

In order to keep couchbase server secure ypu need:
1. Setup firewall to block epmd port 4369 from access outside of cluster network
2. Setup firewall to block erlang ports from access outside of cluster network. These ports are configurable. In our default installation they are: 21100-21299
3. Restrict read and write access to the following directories:

       For linux:
       /opt/couchbase

       For Mac OS:
       /Users/<user>/Library/Application Support/Couchbase/var/lib/couchbase
       /Applications/Couchbase\ Server.app/Contents/Resources/couchbase-core

       For Win (assuming default install location):
       C:\Program Files\Couchbase Server\

   Basically it means not to give anyone passwords to root and the user under which couchbase is installed.
4. Keep Administrator password secure
